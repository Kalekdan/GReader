# GReader
GReader is a small program that will allow you to view your game library in a format that you can manage and organise. Using API's from various sources, you will be able to collate all you're game libraries into a single location where you can leave comments, tag games to play and export your game list to a format suitable for yourself. 

GReader is still in development. Currently it can provide you with a table of your steam library which you can sort by name/playtime.
To use, download the repository and build. Run using your steamid (17 digit number) as a command line parameter and it will provide you with your steam library.


# Roadmap
Eventually, I hope for GReader to support all the main pc game platforms
 - Steam
 - Uplay
 - Origin
 - Battle.net
 - Discord
 - Epic Games
 - GOG galaxy
 - etc.
 
It will also support annotating individual games with information such as ratings, notes, genres etc
You will be able to export your game list into many suitable formats such as .csv, .tsv, .xls and any other deemed appropriate.
